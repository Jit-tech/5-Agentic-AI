# Agri-AI Ireland Agentics

Multi-Agentic AI Simulator for Ireland’s Agriculture and Food Systems
Built with Streamlit | Strategic. Data-Driven.

## Project Overview

This prototype simulates a fictional but data-driven AI Council made up of five specialized agentic intelligences designed to address real-world agricultural and food policy challenges in Ireland. The agents interact with county-level data, produce strategic insights, and offer policy nudges—delivered with a mix of academic rigour and comedic relief.
